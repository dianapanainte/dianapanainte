My name is Diana, I am 22 years old and currently in the second semester of a Master's Degree at the University of Vienna.

I have liked programming since my first year of high school, when I started with C++. Then through my Bachelor's Degree, I began to like web development more and more, and in my last year of university, data science and Python. So, my bachelor's thesis theme is based on machine learning and tennis, another hobby of mine (just watching professional players play, especially Simona Halep).
